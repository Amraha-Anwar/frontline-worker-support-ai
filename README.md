# Frontline Worker Support AI 🏥

An AI powered support system designed to streamline emergency and public services for frontline workers and citizens.  
By using *multi agent AI coordination* and *intelligent triage, the system acts like a **24/7 digital assistant* that reduces wait times, clarifies protocols, and connects people to the right services instantly.

## 🚧 Problem

Frontline workers, triage nurses, emergency officers, council staff, social services, and crime responders—face overwhelming workloads with unclear protocols and manual case handling.  
Citizens struggle with long queues, confusing processes, and don't know which service to contact.  
The result is delayed emergency response, frustrated citizens, burnt out workers, and inefficient resource allocation.

## ✅ Solution

With *AI Powered agents*, we can:
- Analyze and prioritize cases automatically based on urgency  
- Match citizens to the right service department instantly  
- Book appointments and pre fill forms without human intervention  
- Send real time updates and reminders in plain language  
- Track case progress from submission to resolution  
- Reduce frontline worker burden while improving citizen experience

## 🎯 Impact

- Faster emergency response times  
- Reduced wait times and queue lengths  
- Lower stress on frontline staff  
- Clear guidance for citizens navigating services  
- Better resource allocation across departments  
- Improved case tracking and accountability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- *Database & Hosting (Firebase)*
- *Agentic AI (Python + OpenAI Agents SDK)*
- *LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash)* →

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Citizen submits request via web form, SMS, or chatbot  
2. *Triage Agent* analyzes case data and assigns urgency level  
3. *Guidance Agent* routes case to appropriate service department  
4. *Booking Agent* automatically schedules appointments and completes paperwork  
5. *Follow up Agent* sends reminders and status updates to citizen  
6. Frontline workers receive prioritized, organized cases with all necessary information

## 📌 Status

Currently in prototype stage.  
The goal is to test with a *pilot program* at a single emergency department or council office before scaling to multiple frontline services across the city.

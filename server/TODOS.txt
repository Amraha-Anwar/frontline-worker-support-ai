1- Understand the folder structure and try to use Relative Paths not Absolute paths,
I uses Absolute path because relative path was giving errors for now.

2- Try to remove unnecessary __init__.py files or use them to create relative paths.

3- Run agent in a loop and maintain context via user_input.

4- use model:gpt-40-mini for all agents.
